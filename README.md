## ðŸ“ˆ Core Features

### Stock Price Prediction
StockSavvy predicts stock prices using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks. By training the model on historical stock data pulled from **yfinance**, it helps users anticipate future stock movements. The predictions are displayed alongside visualizations of historical data and moving averages.

### News Fetching
StockSavvy also includes a news fetching tool that scrapes the latest news articles related to specific stock companies, ensuring that users stay informed about current events that might impact their investments.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Bootstrap, React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Data**: yfinance (for stock data), web scraping (for news fetching)
- **Machine Learning**: LSTM neural networks implemented in Python (Flask server)
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/Heroku compatible

## ðŸ›  Development Process

The development of StockSavvy focused on modularity and scalability, integrating the frontend with backend APIs and testing extensively across devices. The LSTM model was tuned for optimal prediction performance, and large datasets were handled efficiently using **yfinance**.
